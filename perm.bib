               Paradox",
  author    = "Meehl, Paul E",
  abstract  = "Because physical theories typically predict numerical values, an
               improvement in experimental precision reduces the tolerance
               range and hence increases corroborability. In most psychological
               research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a
               prior probability approaching 1/2 of finding a significant
               difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the
               corroboration yielded by ``success'' is very weak, and becomes
               weaker with increased precision. ``Statistical significance''
               plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its
               role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy
               tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium
               placed on experimental ``cuteness'' and a free reliance upon ad
               hoc explanations to avoid refutation.",

  abstract  = "In an age where the amount of data collected from brain imaging
               is increasing constantly, it is of critical importance to
               analyse those data within an accepted framework to ensure proper
               integration and comparison of the information collected. This
               book describes the ideas and procedures that underlie the
               analysis of signals produced by the brain. The aim is to
               understand how the brain works, in terms of its functional
               architecture and dynamics. This book provides the background and
               methodology for the analysis of all types of brain imaging data,
               from functional magnetic resonance imaging to
               magnetoencephalography. Critically, Statistical Parametric
               Mapping provides a widely accepted conceptual framework which
               allows treatment of all these different modalities. This rests
               on an understanding of the brain's functional anatomy and the
               way that measured signals are caused experimentally. The book
               takes the reader from the basic concepts underlying the analysis
               of neuroimaging data to cutting edge approaches that would be
               difficult to find in any other source. Critically, the material
               is presented in an incremental way so that the reader can
               understand the precedents for each new development. This book
               will be particularly useful to neuroscientists engaged in any
               form of brain mapping; who have to contend with the real-world
               problems of data analysis and understanding the techniques they
               are using. It is primarily a scientific treatment and a didactic
               introduction to the analysis of brain imaging data. It can be
               used as both a textbook for students and scientists starting to
               use the techniques, as well as a reference for practicing
               neuroscientists. The book also serves as a companion to the
               software packages that have been developed for brain imaging
               data analysis.An essential reference and companion for users of

              characterized by abnormal muscle contractions for which standard
              medical therapy is often inadequate. For such patients,
              therapeutic brain stimulation is becoming increasingly used.
              OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence and effect sizes for treating
              different types of dystonia with different types of brain
              stimulation and to discuss recent advances relevant to patient
              selection, surgical approach, programming, and mechanism of
              action. EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed was searched for publications on
              the clinical effect of brain stimulation in dystonia up through
              December 31, 2014. Recent meta-analyses, consensus statements,
              and evidence-based guidelines were incorporated. Emphasis was
              placed on deep brain stimulation (DBS) and randomized clinical
              trials; however, other stimulation modalities and trial designs
              were included. For each intervention the mean change in dystonia
              severity, number of patients studied, and evidence of efficacy
              based on American Academy of Neurology criteria were determined.
              FINDINGS: Strong (level B) evidence supports the use of DBS for
              the treatment of primary generalized or segmental dystonia,
              especially when due to mutation in the DYT1 gene, as well as for
              patients with cervical dystonia. Large effect sizes have also
              been reported for DBS treatment of tardive dystonia, writer's
              cramp, cranial dystonia, myoclonus dystonia, and off-state
              dystonia associated with Parkinson disease. Lesser benefit is
              generally seen in dystonia secondary to structural brain damage.
              Other brain stimulation techniques, including epidural cortical
              stimulation and noninvasive brain stimulation, have been
              investigated, but generally report smaller effect sizes in fewer
              patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with dystonia that
              is not adequately controlled with standard medical therapy should
              be referred for consideration of DBS, especially patients with
              generalized, segmental, or cervical dystonia. Other less-invasive
              stimulation modalities require further research before being
              considered a therapeutic alternative.",

              components of structural and functional brain image analysis.
              Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function
              to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has
              been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the
              success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of
              this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process
              in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution
              local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local
              minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to
              apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid
              global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is
              specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It
              substantially reduces the likelihood of producing
              misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The
              increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly
              used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition,
              the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of
              experiments with motion correction. These motion correction
              experiments also investigate how the results are affected by
              different cost functions and interpolation methods.",

              there is little evidence that choices made during gambling tasks
              predict naturalistic risk-taking behaviors such as drug use,
              extreme sports, or even equity investing. To better understand
              the neural basis of naturalistic risk-taking, we scanned
              participants using fMRI while they completed the Balloon Analog
              Risk Task, an experimental measure that includes an active
              decision/choice component and that has been found to correlate
              with a number of naturalistic risk-taking behaviors. In the task,
              as in many naturalistic settings, escalating risk-taking occurs
              under uncertainty and might be experienced either as the
              accumulation of greater potential rewards, or as exposure to
              increasing possible losses (and decreasing expected value). We
              found that areas previously linked to risk and risk-taking
              (bilateral anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and right
              dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) were activated as participants

              decreasing expected value) rather than the increasing potential
              total reward relative to the starting point of the trial. A
              better understanding of how neural activity changes with

               is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it
               characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims
               should not gain credence because of the status or authority of
               their originator but by the replicability of their supporting
               evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have
               irreproducible empirical findings because of random or
               systematic error. \#\#\# RATIONALE There is concern about the
               rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence.
               Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting,
               selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the
               conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct
               replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed
               sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is
               the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new
               data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain
               an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological
               science. \#\#\# RESULTS We conducted replications of 100
               experimental and correlational studies published in three
               psychology journals using high-powered designs and original
               materials when available. There is no single standard for
               evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated
               reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes,
               subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis
               of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication
               effects ( M r = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the
               mean effect size of the original effects ( M r = 0.403, SD =
               0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent
               of original studies had significant results ( P Original study

               replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were

               original effects, representing a substantial decline.
               Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically
               significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had
               statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes
               were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect
               size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated
               the original result; and if no bias in original results is
               assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\%
               with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests

              argue here that it is often mis-applied, with severe consequences

              Blood flow changes were evaluated by a spin-echo inversion

              8-Hz patterned-flash photic stimulation, a significant increase

              sources make it difficult to assess the validity of various steps

              methods used for fMRI analysis assume that observations are

              methods used to detect activations, without reference to
              estimates of statistical significance. The statistics used in

              detected activations to the number of false-positive findings.
              The main findings are as follows: Preprocessing. The removal of
              intensity drifts and high-pass filtering applied on the voxel
              time-course level is beneficial to the efficacy of analysis.
              Temporal normalization of the global image intensity, smoothing

              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The fuzzy-c-means clustering
              algorithm was applied to resting state fMRI data in cortical and
              subcortical gray matter from two groups acquired separately, one
              of 17 healthy individuals and the second of 21 healthy
              individuals. Different numbers of clusters and different starting
              conditions were used. A cluster dispersion measure determined the
              optimal numbers of clusters. An inner product metric provided a
              measure of similarity between different clusters. The two cluster
              result found the task-negative and task-positive systems. The
              cluster dispersion measure was minimized with seven and eleven
              clusters. Each of the clusters in the seven and eleven cluster
              result was associated with either the task-negative or
              task-positive system. Applying the algorithm to find seven
              clusters recovered previously described resting state networks,
              including the default mode network, frontoparietal control
              network, ventral and dorsal attention networks, somatomotor,
              visual, and language networks. The language and ventral attention
              networks had significant subcortical involvement. This

              The clustering of resting state activity using different optimal
              numbers of clusters identified resting state networks comparable

              effects: the inclusion of regressors describing movement-related
              effects in the design matrix of a General Linear Model (GLM). The
              data were analysed with and without modeling the residual
              movement artefacts and the impact on inter-session variance was
              assessed using F-contrasts. Inclusion of motion parameters in the
              analysis significantly reduced both the intra-subject as well as
              the inter-subject-variance.",

              method for inference in neuroimaging analysis. However, they are
              computationally intensive. For small, non-imaging datasets,
              recomputing a model thousands of times is seldom a problem, but
              for large, complex models this can be prohibitively slow, even
              with the availability of inexpensive computing power. Here we
              exploit properties of statistics used with the general linear
              model (GLM) and their distributions to obtain accelerations
              irrespective of generic software or hardware improvements. We
              compare the following approaches: (i) performing a small number
              of permutations; (ii) estimating the p-value as a parameter of a
              negative binomial distribution; (iii) fitting a generalised
              Pareto distribution to the tail of the permutation distribution;
              (iv) computing p-values based on the expected moments of the
              permutation distribution, approximated from a gamma distribution;
              (v) direct fitting of a gamma distribution to the empirical
              permutation distribution; and (vi) permuting a reduced number of
              voxels, with completion of the remainder using low rank matrix
              theory. Using synthetic data we assessed the different methods in
              terms of their error rates, power, agreement with a reference
              result, and the risk of taking a different decision regarding the
              rejection of the null hypotheses (known as the resampling risk).
              We also conducted a re-analysis of a voxel-based morphometry
              study as a real-data example. All methods yielded exact error
              rates. Likewise, power was similar across methods. Resampling
              risk was higher for methods (i), (iii) and (v). For comparable
              resampling risks, the method in which no permutations are done
              (iv) was the absolute fastest. All methods produced visually
              similar maps for the real data, with stronger effects being
              detected in the family-wise error rate corrected maps by (iii)
              and (v), and generally similar to the results seen in the
              reference set. Overall, for uncorrected p-values, method (iv) was

              Cereb Blood Flow Metab 16:7-22), the permutation approach readily
              accounts for the multiple comparisons problem implicit in the

              appropriate assumptions hold, the nonparametric permutation
              approach gives results similar to those obtained from a
              comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach using a
              general linear model with multiple comparisons corrections
              derived from random field theory. For analyses with low degrees

              multi-subject PET/SPECT or fMRI designs assessed for population

              nonparametric techniques can be used to verify the validity of
              less computationally expensive parametric approaches. Although

              dystonia. This review examines recent developments in the
              application of DBS to the management of movement disorders.
              RECENT FINDINGS: In Parkinson's disease, recent work has
              demonstrated that early DBS may have a significant benefit on
              quality of life and motor symptoms while permitting a decrease in
              levodopa equivalent dosage. Thalamic DBS continues to be a well
              established target for the treatment of tremor, although recent
              work suggests that alternative targets such as the posterior
              subthalamic area may be similarly efficacious. The treatment of
              primary dystonia with DBS has been established in multiple recent
              trials, demonstrating prolonged symptomatic benefit. SUMMARY: DBS
              is now an established symptomatic treatment modality for
              Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. Future work
              will undoubtedly involve establishing new indications and targets
              in the treatment of movement disorders with further refinements
              to existing technology. Ultimately, these methods combined with
              biologically based therapies may catalyze a shift from

  abstract = "Cluster-extent based thresholding is currently the most popular
              method for multiple comparisons correction of statistical maps in
              neuroimaging studies, due to its high sensitivity to weak and
              diffuse signals. However, cluster-extent based thresholding
              provides low spatial specificity; researchers can only infer that
              there is signal somewhere within a significant cluster and cannot
              make inferences about the statistical significance of specific
              locations within the cluster. This poses a particular problem
              when one uses a liberal cluster-defining primary threshold (i.e.,
              higher p-values), which often produces large clusters spanning
              multiple anatomical regions. In such cases, it is impossible to
              reliably infer which anatomical regions show true effects. From a
              survey of 814 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              studies published in 2010 and 2011, we show that the use of
              liberal primary thresholds (e.g., p<.01) is endemic, and that the
              largest determinant of the primary threshold level is the default
              option in the software used. We illustrate the problems with
              liberal primary thresholds using an fMRI dataset from our

              detrimental effects of liberal primary thresholds on false
              positives, localization, and interpretation of fMRI findings. To
              avoid these pitfalls, we recommend several analysis and reporting
              procedures, including 1) setting primary p<.001 as a default
              lower limit; 2) using more stringent primary thresholds or
              voxel-wise correction methods for highly powered studies; and 3)
              adopting reporting practices that make the level of spatial
              precision transparent to readers. We also suggest alternative and

              procedure for reducing these artifacts by deleting (or

              there are problems with accounting for temporal autocorrelations
              when assessing change within voxels. Techniques to date have
              utilized temporal filtering strategies to either shape these
              autocorrelations or remove them. Shaping, or ``coloring,''
              attempts to negate the effects of not accurately knowing the
              intrinsic autocorrelations by imposing known autocorrelation via
              temporal filtering. Removing the autocorrelation, or
              ``prewhitening,'' gives the best linear unbiased estimator,
              assuming that the autocorrelation is accurately known. For
              single-event designs, the efficiency of the estimator is
              considerably higher for prewhitening compared with coloring.
              However, it has been suggested that sufficiently accurate
              estimates of the autocorrelation are currently not available to
              give prewhitening acceptable bias. To overcome this, we consider
              different ways to estimate the autocorrelation for use in
              prewhitening. After high-pass filtering is performed, a Tukey
              taper (set to smooth the spectral density more than would
              normally be used in spectral density estimation) performs best.
              Importantly, estimation is further improved by using nonlinear
              spatial filtering to smooth the estimated autocorrelation, but
              only within tissue type. Using this approach when prewhitening
              reduced bias to close to zero at probability levels as low as 1 x

              have reported multiple activation foci associated with a variety
              of conditions, stimuli or tasks. However, most of these studies
              used fewer than 40 participants. METHODOLOGY: After extracting
              data (number of subjects, condition studied, number of foci
              identified and threshold) from 94 brain fMRI meta-analyses (k =
              1,788 unique datasets) published through December of 2011, we
              analyzed the correlation between individual study sample sizes
              and number of significant foci reported. We also performed an
              analysis where we evaluated each meta-analysis to test whether
              there was a correlation between the sample size of the
              meta-analysis and the number of foci that it had identified.
              Correlation coefficients were then combined across all
              meta-analyses to obtain a summary correlation coefficient with a
              fixed effects model and we combine correlation coefficients,
              using a Fisher's z transformation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: There was
              no correlation between sample size and the number of foci
              reported in single studies (r = 0.0050) but there was a strong
              correlation between sample size and number of foci in
              meta-analyses (r = 0.62, p40) numbers of foci and claimed as many
              discovered foci as studies with sample sizes $\geq$ 45, whereas
              meta-analyses yielded a limited number of foci relative to the
              yield that would be anticipated from smaller single studies.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with possible reporting
              biases affecting small fMRI studies and suggest the need to
              promote standardized large-scale evidence in this field. It may
              also be that small studies may be analyzed and reported in ways
              that may generate a larger number of claimed foci or that small

              open-source Python toolbox for advanced neuroimaging analyses. We

              fMRI data and then create a synthetic dataset with matched noise
              properties and a user-specified signal. Results: We validate the

              help researchers find the optimal design in terms of power.

              detection of the BOLD response it has been clear that the signal
              exhibits interesting dynamics, such as a pronounced and
              long-lasting post-stimulus undershoot. The BOLD response,
              reflecting a change in local deoxyhemoglobin, is a combination of
              a hemodynamic response, related to changes in blood flow and
              venous blood volume, and a metabolic response related to oxygen
              metabolism. Modeling is potentially a way to understand the
              complex path from changes in neural activity to the BOLD signal.
              In the early days of fMRI it was hoped that the
              hemodynamic/metabolic response could be modeled in a unitary way,
              with blood flow, oxygen metabolism, and venous blood volume-the
              physiological factors that affect local deoxyhemoglobin-all
              tightly linked. The balloon model was an attempt to do this,
              based on the physiological ideas of limited oxygen delivery at
              baseline and a slow recovery of venous blood volume after the
              stimulus (the balloon effect), and this simple model of the
              physiology worked well to simulate the BOLD response. However,
              subsequent experiments suggest a more complicated picture of the
              underlying physiology, with blood flow and oxygen metabolism
              driven in parallel, possibly by different aspects of neural
              activity. In addition, it is still not clear whether the
              post-stimulus undershoot is a hemodynamic or a metabolic
              phenomenon, although the original venous balloon effect is
              unlikely to be the full explanation, and a flow undershoot is
              likely to be important. Although our understanding of the physics
              of the BOLD response is now reasonably solid, our understanding
              of the underlying physiological relationships is still relatively
              poor, and this is the primary hurdle for future models of BOLD
              dynamics.",

              {fMRI} Studies",
  author   = "Yeung, Andy W K",
  abstract = "Background: Since the early 2010s, the neuroimaging field has
              paid more attention to the issue of false positives. Several
              journals have issued guidelines regarding statistical thresholds.
              Three papers have reported the statistical analysis of the
              thresholds used in fMRI literature, but they were published at
              least 3 years ago and surveyed papers published during 2007-2012.
              This study revisited this topic to evaluate the changes in this
              field. Methods: The PubMed database was searched to identify the
              task-based (not resting-state) fMRI papers published in 2017 and
              record their sample sizes, inferential methods (e.g., voxelwise
              or clusterwise), theoretical methods (e.g., parametric or
              non-parametric), significance level, cluster-defining primary
              threshold (CDT), volume of analysis (whole brain or region of
              interest) and software used. Results: The majority (95.6\%) of
              the 388 analyzed articles reported statistics corrected for
              multiple comparisons. A large proportion (69.6\%) of the 388
              articles reported main results by clusterwise inference. The
              analyzed articles mostly used software Statistical Parametric
              Mapping (SPM), Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI), or
              FMRIB Software Library (FSL) to conduct statistical analysis.
              There were 70.9\%, 37.6\%, and 23.1\% of SPM, AFNI, and FSL
              studies, respectively, that used a CDT of p $\leq$ 0.001. The
              statistical sample size across the articles ranged between 7 and
              1,299 with a median of 33. Sample size did not significantly
              correlate with the level of statistical threshold. Conclusion:
              There were still around 53\% (142/270) studies using clusterwise
              inference that chose a more liberal CDT than p = 0.001 (n = 121)
              or did not report their CDT (n = 21), down from around 61\%
              reported by Woo et al. (2014). For FSL studies, it seemed that
              the CDT practice had no improvement since the survey by Woo et
              al. (2014). A few studies chose unconventional CDT such as p =
              0.0125 or 0.004. Such practice might create an impression that
              the threshold alterations were attempted to show ``desired''
              clusters. The median sample size used in the analyzed articles
              was similar to those reported in previous surveys. In conclusion,
              there seemed to be no change in the statistical practice compared
              to the early 2010s.",

              simulations and ROC curves by using real PET and fMRI data sets
              to examine the relationship between prediction accuracy and the
              signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) associated with reproducible SPMs.
              Using cross-validation resampling we plot training-test set
              predictions of the experimental design variables (e.g.,
              brain-state labels) versus reproducibility SNR metrics for the

              [(15)O]water PET studies of 12 age- and sex-matched data sets

              data sets we apply NPAIRS with both univariate and multivariate
              data-analysis approaches to: (1) demonstrate that this framework
              may be used to obtain reproducible SPMs from any data-analysis
              approach on a common Z-score scale (rSPM[Z]); (2) demonstrate
              that the histogram of a rSPM[Z] image may be modeled as the sum
              of a data-analysis-dependent noise distribution and a
              task-dependent, Gaussian signal distribution that scales
              monotonically with our reproducibility performance metric; (3)
              explore the relation between prediction and reproducibility
              performance metrics with an emphasis on bias-variance tradeoffs
              for flexible, multivariate models; and (4) measure the broad

              individual subjects. A companion paper describes learning curves

              of VBM and then focuses on exemplar applications in healthy and
              diseased subjects. The procedure involves normalising
              high-resolution structural magnetic resonance images to a
              standard template in stereotactic space. Normalised images are
              then segmented into gray and white matter and smoothed using an
              isotropic Gaussian kernel. Finally, a series of voxel-wise
              comparisons of gray and white matter in different groups of
              subjects are performed, using Random Field theory to correct for
              multiple comparisons. VBM has been useful in characterizing
              subtle changes in brain structure in a variety of diseases

              the potential for false positives increases with the flexibility
              of analysis methods. Functional MRI (fMRI) experiments can be
              analyzed using a large number of commonly used tools, with little

              situation may lead to substantial variability in analysis
              outcomes. Thus, the present study sought to estimate the
              flexibility of neuroimaging analysis by submitting a single
              event-related fMRI experiment to a large number of unique
              analysis procedures. Ten analysis steps for which multiple
              strategies appear in the literature were identified, and two to
              four strategies were enumerated for each step. Considering all
              possible combinations of these strategies yielded 6,912 unique
              analysis pipelines. Activation maps from each pipeline were
              corrected for multiple comparisons using five thresholding
              approaches, yielding 34,560 significance maps. While some
              outcomes were relatively consistent across pipelines, others
              showed substantial methods-related variability in activation
              strength, location, and extent. Some analysis decisions
              contributed to this variability more than others, and different
              decisions were associated with distinct patterns of variability
              across the brain. Qualitative outcomes also varied with analysis
              parameters: many contrasts yielded significant activation under
              some pipelines but not others. Altogether, these results reveal
              considerable flexibility in the analysis of fMRI experiments.
              This observation, when combined with mathematical simulations
              linking analytic flexibility with elevated false positive rates,
              suggests that false positive results may be more prevalent than
              expected in the literature. This risk of inflated false positive

              neuronal firing during stimulation or task in regions beyond
              those of primary relationship to the perturbation. Although the
              biological origin of consciousness remains elusive, it is argued
              that it emerges from complex, continuous whole-brain neuronal
              collaboration. Despite converging evidence suggesting the whole
              brain is continuously working and adapting to anticipate and
              actuate in response to the environment, over the last 20 y,
              task-based functional MRI (fMRI) have emphasized a
              localizationist view of brain function, with fMRI showing only a
              handful of activated regions in response to task/stimulation.
              Here, we challenge that view with evidence that under optimal
              noise conditions, fMRI activations extend well beyond areas of
              primary relationship to the task; and blood-oxygen
              level-dependent signal changes correlated with task-timing appear
              in over 95\% of the brain for a simple visual stimulation plus
              attention control task. Moreover, we show that response shape
              varies substantially across regions, and that whole-brain
              parcellations based on those differences produce distributed
              clusters that are anatomically and functionally meaningful,
              symmetrical across hemispheres, and reproducible across subjects.
              These findings highlight the exquisite detail lying in fMRI
              signals beyond what is normally examined, and emphasize both the
              pervasiveness of false negatives, and how the sparseness of fMRI
              maps is not a result of localized brain function, but a
              consequence of high noise and overly strict predictive response

               original data nor stationarity or smoothness of the limiting

  abstract = "Exactly 100 years ago, the Nobel Prize for Physiology and
              Medicine was awarded to Santiago Ram{\'o}n y Cajal, ``in
              recognition of his meritorious work on the structure of the
              nervous system''. Cajal's great contribution to the history of
              science is undoubtedly the postulate of neuron theory. The
              present work makes a historical analysis of the circumstances in
              which Cajal formulated his theory, considering the authors and
              works that influenced his postulate, the difficulties he
              encountered for its dissemination, and the way it finally became
              established. At the time when Cajal began his neurohistological
              studies, in 1887, Gerlach's reticular theory (a diffuse
              protoplasmic network of the grey matter of the nerve centres),
              also defended by Golgi, prevailed among the scientific community.
              In the first issue of the Revista Trimestral de Histolog{\'\i}a
              Normal y Patol{\'o}gica (May, 1888), Cajal presented the
              definitive evidence underpinning neuron theory, thanks to
              staining of the axon of the small, star-shaped cells of the
              molecular layer of the cerebellum of birds, whose collaterals end
              up surrounding the Purkinje cell bodies, in the form of baskets
              or nests. He thus demonstrated once and for all that the
              relationship between nerve cells was not one of continuity, but
              rather of contiguity. Neuron theory is one of the principal
              scientific conquests of the 20th century, and which has
              withstood, with scarcely any modifications, the passage of more
              than a 100 years, being reaffirmed by new technologies, as the
              electron microscopy. Today, no neuroscientific discipline could
              be understood without recourse to the concept of neuronal
              individuality and nervous transmission at a synaptic level, as
              basic units of the nervous system.",

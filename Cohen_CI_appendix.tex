Comparing with Fig.\ \ref{fig:HCP_Algorithm_3} and Fig.\ \ref{fig:HCP_Algorithm_2}, the CSs presented here are slightly more conservative than the corresponding CSs obtained with Algorithm \ref{alg:two}. and Algorithm \ref{alg:three}.\ (in the sense that the red upper CSs here are smaller, and blue lower CSs are larger). This is consistent with the simulation results obtained in Section \ref{sec:2D_sim_results} and \ref{sec:3d_sim_results}, where the empirical coverage for Algorithm \ref{alg:one}.\ was consistently larger than the other two methods.}
